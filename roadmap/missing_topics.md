## Status of Knowledge Base Files

All topic files have been created with TODO placeholders. The following tracks what still needs to be FILLED IN with actual learning content.

## High Priority - Fill In Next

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (deepen what you already use)
- **four-pillars.md** - Need concrete C# examples of when to use/not use each pillar
- **solid-principles.md** - Need code examples for each principle, especially violations and fixes
- **creational-patterns.md** - Start with Singleton, Factory, Builder - most common in .NET
- **structural-patterns.md** - Start with Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- **algorithm-fundamentals.md** - Big O notation, practical sorting/searching knowledge

### Phase 2: Architecture (formalize practical experience)
- **clean-architecture.md** - C# project structure, understand how it differs from N-Tier
- **domain-driven-design.md** - Bounded contexts, aggregates, ubiquitous language
- **system-design-practice.md** - Practice whiteboard problems
- **scalability.md** - Load balancing, horizontal scaling, database scaling

### Phase 5: Security
- **owasp-top-10.md** - All 10 categories with .NET-specific prevention

### Phase 6: AI/LLM (career differentiator)
- **how-llms-work.md** - Transformers, tokenization, context windows
- **rag.md** - RAG pipeline, chunking, embeddings
- **vector-databases.md** - Embeddings, similarity search, database options
- **mcp.md** - MCP architecture, building servers

## Medium Priority

### Phase 1 (continued)
- **composition-vs-inheritance.md** - Side-by-side C# examples
- **interfaces-vs-abstract-classes.md** - Decision tree for when to use each
- **coupling-and-cohesion.md** - Types of coupling, measurement
- **behavioral-patterns.md** - Observer, Strategy, Command, Mediator
- **code-smells-and-refactoring.md** - Common smells with code examples
- **error-handling.md** - Exception strategy, Result pattern

### Phase 2 (continued)
- **event-driven-architecture.md** - CQRS, event sourcing, RabbitMQ deep dive
- **databases.md** - CAP theorem, NoSQL, advanced indexing
- **api-design.md** - GraphQL, gRPC
- **caching.md** - Redis, cache invalidation strategies

### Phase 3: DevOps
- **kubernetes.md** - Core concepts, when to use
- **monitoring-and-observability.md** - Three pillars, alerting

### Phase 4: Testing
- **unit-testing.md** - Mocking, best practices, what to test
- **tdd.md** - Red-Green-Refactor practice

### Phase 5 (continued)
- **authentication-and-authorization.md** - OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT deep dive
- **secure-coding-practices.md** - Security headers, dependency scanning

## Low Priority

### Phase 1 (continued)
- **dependency-injection.md** - Already strong, just document patterns
- **naming-and-functions.md** - Already practicing, formalize

### Phase 3 (continued)
- **git-advanced.md** - Rebasing, cherry-picking, bisect
- **cicd.md** - Deployment strategies
- **docker.md** - Already working knowledge, optimize images
- **azure-fundamentals.md** - Expand beyond Azure DevOps

### Phase 6 (continued)
- **prompt-engineering.md** - Formalize prompting techniques
- **local-ai-models.md** - LM Studio, Ollama setup
- **ai-augmented-development.md** - Best practices for AI-assisted coding

### Phase 7: Soft Skills
- **technical-communication.md** - ADRs, design docs
- **mentorship-and-leadership.md** - Already practicing, formalize

### Phase 8: Fundamentals
- **compilation-chain.md** - Already have embedded background, document it
- **networking-fundamentals.md** - Deepen TCP/IP, DNS understanding

## Note
Technology-specific folders (dotnet/, angular/, AI/) were removed since those topics are covered across the roadmap folders. .NET and Angular knowledge is documented within the relevant topic files (e.g., DI examples in OOP, EF in databases, Angular patterns in architecture).
