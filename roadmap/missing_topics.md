# Missing Topics

## High Priority

### Object-Oriented Programming Prerequisites

- **Loose vs Tight Coupling** - Fundamental concept that underlies SOLID principles. Need practical code examples showing the difference, how to identify tight coupling, and refactoring techniques.
- **Abstract Class vs Interface** - Critical decision point in OOP design. When to use each, differences in implementation, language-specific considerations (C# vs TypeScript).
- **Composition vs Inheritance** - Foundational design choice. When to prefer composition, how it relates to LSP and ISP, practical examples.
- **Access Modifiers (in depth)** - Currently only mentioned. Need understanding of `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal` (C#), visibility rules, and their impact on design decisions.
- **Classes (detailed)** - File exists but is empty. Need understanding of class structure, constructors, methods, properties, static members, instance vs class members.

## Medium Priority

### Object-Oriented Programming Depth Topics

- **Design Patterns (basics)** - File exists but empty. Start with foundational patterns: Factory, Singleton, Strategy. Understand how they relate to SOLID principles.
- **Encapsulation vs Abstraction** - Clear distinction needed. Both concepts are mentioned but relationship is unclear.
- **Polymorphism (detailed)** - Currently only one sentence. Need understanding of compile-time vs runtime polymorphism, method overriding, method overloading.
- **Inheritance (detailed)** - Currently only one sentence. Need understanding of single vs multiple inheritance, inheritance chains, virtual methods, base class usage.
- **Dependency Injection Container/IoC Container** - Manual DI is understood, but container-based DI is not. Need to understand DI frameworks, service registration, lifetime management.
- **ISP - Fat Interface Problem** - Concept understood but needs concrete example of bad interface design and how to split it.
- **Sealed Class** - Mentioned in terms but not explained. What it is, when to use it, language-specific implementation.

## Low Priority

### Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Topics

- **Clean Architecture** - Mentioned in DIP context but structure not understood. Can wait until foundations are solid.
- **Advanced Design Patterns** - After learning basic patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy), can explore Observer, Decorator, Adapter patterns.

### Senior Roadmap Topics (see senior-dev-roadmap.md)

- **System Design** - Load balancing, caching, database sharding, API design, distributed systems
- **DevOps & CI/CD** - Docker, Kubernetes, deployment strategies, monitoring & observability
- **Security** - OWASP Top 10, OAuth/JWT, prompt injection, secure coding practices
- **AI/LLM Ecosystem** - RAG pipelines, vector databases, MCP servers, local AI models, prompt engineering
- **Testing** - Testing pyramid, TDD, integration testing, code quality practices
- **Soft Skills** - Technical writing, mentorship, stakeholder management, estimation
- **How Computers Work** - Compilation chain, machine code vs assembly vs high-level, managed vs unmanaged code
