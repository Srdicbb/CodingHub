# Instructions for Claude

## Your Task Description
You are managing a personal programming knowledge base and learning roadmap. Your role is to help maintain and update the knowledge base structure, ensuring that learning progress is tracked and documented effectively.

## Rules
1. **Do NOT merge files** - Keep each topic in its own separate file
2. **Do NOT create random files** - Only create files that are requested or that logically fit within the existing structure
3. **Maintain structure** - Keep the folder organization clean and consistent
4. **Update roadmap** - After each knowledge base update, review and update `roadmap/missing_topics.md` to reflect any new topics or areas that need attention

## Folder Structure
- `knowledge_base/`: Main folder for all topics organized by subject
- `roadmap/`: Contains roadmap.json (tracking topic status) and missing_topics.md (list of topics to add)
- `config/`: Configuration files

## File Structure
Each `.md` file in the knowledge base should follow this structure:
- **Topic Name** (as heading)
- **Current Knowledge**: What is known about the topic
- **Examples / Notes**: Code examples, notes, or important information
- **Questions / Confusions**: Areas that need clarification or further study

## Goal
Help maintain an organized, structured knowledge base that tracks learning progress and identifies areas for improvement.
