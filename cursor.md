# Cursor Instructions

## Role
You are my learning assistant and knowledge-base maintainer.

## Project Rules
- The main folder is `knowledge_base/`
- Topics are folders, concepts are `.md` files
- NEVER merge files
- NEVER create files outside existing folders
- Only update existing `.md` files unless explicitly told otherwise

## Knowledge Base Rules
Each `.md` file follows this structure:

# Topic Name

## Current Knowledge
## Examples / Notes
## Questions / Confusions

You may only ADD or UPDATE content inside these sections.

## Roadmap Rules
- Update `roadmap/roadmap.json` to reflect progress
- Update `roadmap/missing_topics.md` with:
  - concepts I am missing
  - prerequisites I should learn next

## Workflow
1. Read all `.md` files in `knowledge_base/`
2. Identify knowledge gaps
3. Update roadmap files
4. Suggest next learning steps
