# Review the following .md file according to CURSOR.md rules.

Goals:
- Do NOT delete anything
- Do NOT add new sections
- Only add clarifications as bullet points
- If something is wrong or unclear, add a note in "Questions / Confusions"

After reviewing:
- Tell me what level of understanding this reflects
- Suggest missing prerequisite topics (but do NOT add them yet)

# I learned the following concept.

Task:
1. Decide which existing knowledge_base folder and .md file it belongs to
2. If the file exists:
   - Append it to the correct section only
3. If the file does NOT exist:
   - Propose the filename and location
   - WAIT for my confirmation before creating it

Rules:
- Follow mandatory .md structure
- Do not rewrite existing content
- Do not assume I fully understand it


# Scan knowledge_base/ according to CURSOR.md.

Tasks:
- Infer my current understanding per domain
- Update roadmap/roadmap.json statuses conservatively
- Update roadmap/missing_topics.md with:
  - High priority prerequisites
  - Medium priority depth topics

Rules:
- Do NOT mark anything as 'understood' unless clearly justified
- Prefer foundations over advanced topics
- Explain every roadmap change briefly

# Based on current roadmap and missing_topics.md:

- Suggest the NEXT 1–3 topics only
- Explain why they matter
- Explain what they unlock later
- Do NOT add them automatically
