# Secure Coding Practices

> Phase 5.2 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Use parameterized queries through EF/Dapper/ADO.NET
- Handle CORS configuration
- Need to learn security headers, dependency scanning, least privilege

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Input validation - whitelist over blacklist
- TODO: Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in ASP.NET Core
- TODO: Principle of least privilege in code and infrastructure
- TODO: Dependency scanning tools (Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check)
- TODO: Prompt injection prevention (for AI-integrated apps)

## Questions / Confusions

- How to add security headers in ASP.NET Core middleware?
- What's a good dependency scanning workflow for CI/CD?
