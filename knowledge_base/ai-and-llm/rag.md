# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

> Phase 6.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Know the concept exists but haven't built one
- Understand the knowledge cutoff problem from using AI

## Examples / Notes

### What RAG Is
- TODO: Why LLMs need external data (knowledge cutoff, private data)
- TODO: RAG vs fine-tuning - when to use which
- TODO: Basic RAG architecture diagram

### RAG Pipeline
- TODO: Document loading (PDF, text, web pages)
- TODO: Chunking strategies (fixed size, semantic, recursive)
- TODO: Chunk size and overlap - why they matter
- TODO: Embedding models (OpenAI, local alternatives)
- TODO: Vector storage and retrieval
- TODO: Context stuffing into prompt
- TODO: Re-ranking retrieved results

### Building a RAG System
- TODO: End-to-end implementation (Python or C#)
- TODO: LangChain / Semantic Kernel frameworks
- TODO: Evaluation metrics (relevance, faithfulness)
- TODO: Common failure modes and debugging

## Questions / Confusions

- Can I build RAG with .NET (Semantic Kernel)?
- What's the minimum viable RAG system?
- How to evaluate if RAG is giving good answers?
