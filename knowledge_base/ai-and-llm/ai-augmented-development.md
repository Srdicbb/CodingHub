# AI-Augmented Development

> Phase 6.5 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Used Lavaable AI for React frontend in ESG project
- Using Claude Code for this knowledge base
- Need to formalize best practices

## Examples / Notes

### Tools
- TODO: Claude Code - strengths, weaknesses, best use cases
- TODO: GitHub Copilot - inline code completion
- TODO: Cursor - AI-first IDE
- TODO: When to use which tool

### Best Practices
- TODO: Reviewing AI-generated code critically
- TODO: Knowing when AI output is wrong (hallucinations in code)
- TODO: Effective prompting for code generation
- TODO: Using AI for learning vs production code

### AI Security
- TODO: Prompt injection attacks and defenses
- TODO: Data leakage through AI tools
- TODO: Supply chain risks with AI-generated code
- TODO: Responsible AI usage in enterprise settings

## Questions / Confusions

- How to verify AI-generated code is correct and secure?
- Should I review AI code differently than human code?
- What are the legal implications of AI-generated code?
