# Prompt Engineering

> Phase 6.1 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Use prompts with Claude Code and other AI tools daily
- Need to formalize techniques

## Examples / Notes

### Prompt Structure
- TODO: System prompts vs user prompts vs assistant messages
- TODO: Role assignment ("You are a senior .NET developer...")
- TODO: Context providing

### Techniques
- TODO: Zero-shot prompting (just ask)
- TODO: Few-shot prompting (give examples first)
- TODO: Chain-of-thought ("think step by step")
- TODO: Structured output (JSON mode, schema definition)

### For Code Generation
- TODO: How to write prompts that generate good code
- TODO: Providing code context effectively
- TODO: Iterative refinement

## Questions / Confusions

- What makes a prompt "good" vs "bad"?
- How to get consistent structured output from LLMs?
- How does the CLAUDE.md file in this project relate to system prompts?
