# Creational Design Patterns

> Phase 1.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Heard of Singleton and Factory but haven't formally studied them
- Need to learn all five creational patterns and when to apply each

## Examples / Notes

### Singleton
- TODO: Implementation in C#
- TODO: Why it's often an anti-pattern
- TODO: Thread-safe singleton

### Factory Method
- TODO: When to use over direct instantiation
- TODO: C# example

### Abstract Factory
- TODO: Difference from Factory Method
- TODO: Real-world use case

### Builder
- TODO: When objects have many optional parameters
- TODO: Fluent builder pattern in C#

### Prototype
- TODO: Deep copy vs shallow copy
- TODO: ICloneable in C#

## Questions / Confusions

- Which creational patterns are most commonly used in .NET projects?
- How do DI containers relate to Factory patterns?
- When is "just new it up" the right answer vs using a pattern?
