# Structural Design Patterns

> Phase 1.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Limited formal knowledge of structural patterns
- May have used some unknowingly in .NET projects

## Examples / Notes

### Adapter
- TODO: Converting one interface to another
- TODO: Real-world example (external API integration)

### Decorator
- TODO: Adding behavior without modifying class
- TODO: Middleware in ASP.NET Core as decorator pattern

### Facade
- TODO: Simplifying complex subsystems
- TODO: Service layer as a facade

### Proxy
- TODO: Controlling access to an object
- TODO: Lazy loading as proxy pattern

### Composite
- TODO: Tree structures
- TODO: When to use

### Bridge
- TODO: Separating abstraction from implementation
- TODO: When to use

## Questions / Confusions

- Which structural patterns appear most in .NET/Angular codebases?
- How does ASP.NET Core middleware relate to the decorator pattern?
- Adapter vs Facade - when to use which?
