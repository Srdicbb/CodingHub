# When NOT to Use Design Patterns

> Phase 1.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Know that over-engineering exists
- Need to develop instinct for when a pattern adds vs removes complexity

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Signs of over-engineering (too many abstractions, simple task made complex)
- TODO: YAGNI applied to patterns
- TODO: Examples of pattern abuse in real codebases
- TODO: "Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction"

## Questions / Confusions

- How do you know when a pattern is needed vs premature?
- What's the cost of introducing a pattern too early?
- How to refactor toward patterns incrementally instead of upfront?
