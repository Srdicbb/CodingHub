# Networking Fundamentals

> Phase 8.2 | Status: Partial | Priority: LOW

## Current Knowledge

- Build REST APIs daily, understand HTTP well
- Use SignalR (WebSockets) in FIS project
- Need to deepen TCP/IP, DNS understanding

## Examples / Notes

### TCP/IP Stack
- TODO: What happens when you type a URL in browser (full journey)
- TODO: OSI model layers (practical understanding)
- TODO: TCP vs UDP - when to use each

### DNS
- TODO: How domain resolution works
- TODO: DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT)
- TODO: DNS caching and TTL

### HTTP/HTTPS
- Already understood from daily REST API work
- TODO: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 improvements
- TODO: How TLS handshake works

### WebSockets
- Used SignalR daily in FIS and ESG projects
- TODO: How WebSocket differs from HTTP at protocol level
- TODO: When to use WebSocket vs SSE vs long polling

### Protocol Comparison
- TODO: REST vs gRPC vs GraphQL at protocol level
- TODO: When to use each

## Questions / Confusions

- How does SignalR decide between WebSocket, SSE, and long polling?
- What's the practical difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3?
