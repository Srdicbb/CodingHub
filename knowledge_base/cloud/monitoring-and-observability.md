# Monitoring and Observability

> Phase 3.4 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Limited experience with production monitoring
- Need to learn the three pillars

## Examples / Notes

### Three Pillars
- TODO: Logs - structured logging, log aggregation (Serilog, ELK stack)
- TODO: Metrics - Prometheus, Grafana, Application Insights
- TODO: Traces - distributed tracing, OpenTelemetry, correlation IDs

### Alerting
- TODO: What to alert on (SLOs, error rates, latency)
- TODO: Alert fatigue and how to avoid it
- TODO: On-call best practices

## Questions / Confusions

- How to set up monitoring from scratch in a .NET project?
- What's the minimum viable monitoring setup?
