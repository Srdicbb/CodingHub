# Core Data Structures

> Phase 1.3 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Use arrays, lists, dictionaries daily in C#
- Need to understand internals (how Dictionary/HashTable works under the hood)
- Trees and Graphs are weak areas

## Examples / Notes

### Arrays & Lists
- TODO: Array vs List<T> vs LinkedList<T> in C#
- TODO: When to use each, performance characteristics

### Hash Tables / Dictionaries
- TODO: How Dictionary<K,V> works internally in C#
- TODO: Hash collisions and resolution strategies
- TODO: GetHashCode() and Equals() importance

### Trees
- TODO: Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Red-Black
- TODO: When trees are used in practice (database indexes)

### Graphs
- TODO: Adjacency list vs adjacency matrix
- TODO: When to model problems as graphs

### Heaps / Priority Queues
- TODO: PriorityQueue in .NET 6+
- TODO: When to use (scheduling, top-K problems)

## Questions / Confusions

- How does C# Dictionary handle hash collisions internally?
- When would I use a tree data structure in a web application?
- What's the practical difference between Stack and Queue usage?
