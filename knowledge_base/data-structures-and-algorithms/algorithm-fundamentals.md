# Algorithm Fundamentals

> Phase 1.3 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Basic understanding of Big O from university
- Need practical application and interview-level understanding

## Examples / Notes

### Big O Notation
- TODO: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2) - with C# examples
- TODO: Space complexity vs Time complexity
- TODO: Common operations and their complexities (Dictionary lookup, List.Sort, etc.)

### Sorting Algorithms
- TODO: QuickSort - how it works, average vs worst case
- TODO: MergeSort - when stable sort matters
- TODO: When to use Array.Sort() vs custom sorting

### Searching
- TODO: Binary Search implementation and prerequisites
- TODO: BFS vs DFS - when to use each
- TODO: Practical applications (file system traversal, shortest path)

### Recursion & Dynamic Programming
- TODO: Recursion basics and stack overflow risks
- TODO: Memoization as optimization
- TODO: Classic DP problems (fibonacci, knapsack)

## Questions / Confusions

- How much algorithm knowledge is actually needed for senior-level work vs interviews?
- What's the most practical subset to focus on?
- How to recognize when a problem needs DP?
