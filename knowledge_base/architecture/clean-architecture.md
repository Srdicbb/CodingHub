# Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture

> Phase 2.1 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Mentioned in DIP context but structure not deeply understood
- Work with layered architecture daily in FIS project

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Core idea - dependency direction points inward
- TODO: Layers: Entities -> Use Cases -> Interface Adapters -> Frameworks
- TODO: Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) - how it relates
- TODO: C# project structure for Clean Architecture
- TODO: How it differs from traditional N-Tier

## Questions / Confusions

- Is Clean Architecture overkill for small/medium projects?
- How to gradually refactor an N-Tier app toward Clean Architecture?
- What's the relationship between Clean Architecture and DDD?
