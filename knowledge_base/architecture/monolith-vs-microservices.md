# Monolith vs Microservices

> Phase 2.1 | Status: Have Experience | Priority: HIGH (formalize)

## Current Knowledge

- Proposed breaking 14-year-old Israeli monolith into microservices with .NET Core
- Built microservices in crypto exchange project (API Gateway, RabbitMQ)
- Need to formalize decision framework for when to use each

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: When monolith is the RIGHT choice (startups, small teams, simple domains)
- TODO: When to migrate to microservices (scaling needs, team independence)
- TODO: The distributed monolith anti-pattern
- TODO: Strangler Fig pattern for gradual migration
- TODO: Document Israeli project migration strategy as case study

## Questions / Confusions

- What team size justifies microservices?
- How to avoid the distributed monolith?
- What's the minimum infrastructure needed for microservices?
