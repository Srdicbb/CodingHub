# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

> Phase 2.1 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Heard about DDD but haven't applied it formally
- Work with business domains (FIS risk assessment) but without DDD vocabulary

## Examples / Notes

### Strategic DDD
- TODO: Bounded Contexts - dividing a large system into clear boundaries
- TODO: Ubiquitous Language - shared vocabulary between devs and business
- TODO: Context Mapping - how bounded contexts relate to each other

### Tactical DDD
- TODO: Entities - objects with identity
- TODO: Value Objects - objects defined by attributes, not identity
- TODO: Aggregates - cluster of entities treated as a unit
- TODO: Domain Events - significant things that happen in the domain
- TODO: Repositories - data access abstraction

## Questions / Confusions

- How to identify bounded contexts in an existing application?
- Is DDD only for large/complex applications?
- How does DDD relate to microservices boundaries?
