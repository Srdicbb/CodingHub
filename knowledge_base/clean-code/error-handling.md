# Error Handling

> Phase 1.4 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Use try/catch in C# and Angular
- Need clearer strategy on when to catch vs propagate

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Exceptions vs error codes - when to use each
- TODO: Custom exception types in C#
- TODO: Global error handling in ASP.NET Core (middleware)
- TODO: Error handling in Angular (interceptors)
- TODO: Don't catch Exception - catch specific types
- TODO: Result pattern as alternative to exceptions

## Questions / Confusions

- When should I let exceptions bubble up vs catch them?
- Is the Result pattern (Result<T>) better than exceptions in C#?
- How to handle errors across microservice boundaries?
