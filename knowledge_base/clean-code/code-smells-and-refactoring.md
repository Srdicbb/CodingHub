# Code Smells and Refactoring

> Phase 1.4 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Refactored poorly written services in Israeli travel agency project
- Proposed monolith-to-microservices migration
- Need to formalize vocabulary for code smells

## Examples / Notes

### Common Code Smells
- TODO: Long Method - signs and refactoring techniques
- TODO: God Class - how to break it apart
- TODO: Feature Envy - when a method uses another class's data too much
- TODO: Primitive Obsession - when to create value objects
- TODO: Shotgun Surgery - one change requires editing many classes
- TODO: Duplicate Code - when DRY applies and when it doesn't

### Refactoring Techniques
- TODO: Extract Method
- TODO: Extract Class
- TODO: Move Method
- TODO: Rename (most common refactoring)
- TODO: Replace conditional with polymorphism

## Questions / Confusions

- How to prioritize which smells to fix first in legacy code?
- When is "good enough" actually good enough?
- How to refactor safely without breaking things (testing first)?
