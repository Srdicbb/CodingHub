# Naming and Functions

> Phase 1.4 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase)
- Write reasonably clean code but want to be more intentional

## Examples / Notes

### Naming
- TODO: Variable names that explain themselves
- TODO: Method names that describe behavior
- TODO: Class names that describe responsibility
- TODO: Bad naming examples and fixes

### Functions
- TODO: Single responsibility in functions
- TODO: Ideal parameter count (0-3)
- TODO: Flag arguments and why they're a smell
- TODO: Side effects and how to avoid them

## Questions / Confusions

- How long should a function be? Is there a real limit?
- When is a comment necessary vs a naming improvement?
- How to name things in domain-specific contexts?
