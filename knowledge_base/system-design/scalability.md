# Scalability

> Phase 2.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Wanted to load test the crypto exchange project but didn't complete it
- Understand the concept but lack hands-on experience with scaling strategies

## Examples / Notes

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- TODO: When to scale up vs scale out
- TODO: Stateless vs stateful services (why stateless scales better)

### Load Balancing
- TODO: Round Robin, Least Connections, Consistent Hashing
- TODO: L4 vs L7 load balancing
- TODO: Azure Load Balancer / Application Gateway

### Database Scaling
- TODO: Read replicas - offloading read traffic
- TODO: Sharding - horizontal partitioning
- TODO: Partitioning strategies

## Questions / Confusions

- How do you know when you need to scale?
- What metrics indicate scaling is needed?
- How to design for scalability from the start without over-engineering?
