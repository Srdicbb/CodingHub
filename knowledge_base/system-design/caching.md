# Caching

> Phase 2.2 | Status: Not Started | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Basic understanding of caching concept
- Haven't implemented Redis or distributed caching

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Cache invalidation strategies (TTL, write-through, write-behind, write-around)
- TODO: Redis - when and how to use
- TODO: In-memory caching in .NET (IMemoryCache, IDistributedCache)
- TODO: CDN caching for static assets
- TODO: Cache-aside pattern

## Questions / Confusions

- When does caching introduce more problems than it solves?
- How to handle cache consistency in distributed systems?
- Redis vs Memcached - when to use which?
