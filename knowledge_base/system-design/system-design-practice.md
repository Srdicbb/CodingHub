## Current Knowledge

- Have practical experience building systems but need structured approach for interviews and design docs

## Examples / Notes

### Framework for System Design
- TODO: Requirements clarification (functional + non-functional)
- TODO: Back-of-envelope estimation
- TODO: High-level design (components, data flow)
- TODO: Detailed design (APIs, data models, algorithms)
- TODO: Bottleneck identification and solutions

### Practice Problems
- TODO: Design a URL shortener
- TODO: Design a chat system (relate to SignalR experience)
- TODO: Design a notification service
- TODO: Design a file storage system
- TODO: Design a rate limiter

## Questions / Confusions
