# Distributed Systems

> Phase 2.3 | Status: Not Started | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Built microservices with API Gateway and RabbitMQ (crypto exchange)
- Need to understand formal distributed systems concepts

## Examples / Notes

### Consistency Models
- TODO: Strong consistency vs eventual consistency
- TODO: When eventual consistency is acceptable

### Patterns
- TODO: Circuit Breaker pattern (Polly in .NET)
- TODO: Retry strategies - exponential backoff with jitter
- TODO: Idempotency - why it matters (duplicate message handling)
- TODO: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Observability
- TODO: Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- TODO: Correlation IDs across services
- TODO: Health checks

### Theory
- TODO: Consensus algorithms - Raft, Paxos (high level understanding)
- TODO: Two-phase commit and its problems
- TODO: Fallacies of distributed computing

## Questions / Confusions

- How to handle transactions across microservices?
- When is eventual consistency a problem for users?
- How to debug issues in a distributed system?
