# Dependency Injection

> Phase 1.1 | Status: Have Experience | Priority: LOW (deepen)

## Current Knowledge

- Used AutoFac in FIS project for multi-tenant architecture
- Understand constructor injection well
- Used in .NET Core built-in DI container
- Know the difference between Transient, Scoped, Singleton lifetimes

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Document AutoFac patterns used in FIS
- TODO: .NET Core built-in DI vs AutoFac vs other containers
- TODO: Property injection vs Constructor injection - when to use each
- TODO: How DI enables unit testing with mocks

## Questions / Confusions

- When is the built-in .NET DI container enough vs needing AutoFac?
- How to handle circular dependencies?
- Best practices for registering services in large applications
