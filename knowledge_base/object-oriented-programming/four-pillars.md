# Four Pillars of OOP

> Phase 1.1 | Status: Partial | Priority: HIGH

## Current Knowledge

- Used daily in C#/.NET projects
- Basic understanding of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Need to deepen understanding of WHEN to use each and WHEN NOT to

## Examples / Notes

### Encapsulation
- TODO: Add examples of proper encapsulation in C#
- TODO: When to use private vs protected vs internal

### Abstraction
- TODO: Real-world examples of abstraction layers
- TODO: Difference between abstraction and encapsulation (they overlap)

### Inheritance
- TODO: When inheritance is the right choice
- TODO: When it becomes a problem (fragile base class, deep hierarchies)

### Polymorphism
- TODO: Compile-time (method overloading) vs Runtime (method overriding)
- TODO: Virtual methods, abstract methods, interfaces as polymorphism

## Questions / Confusions

- When should I choose inheritance over composition?
- How deep should inheritance hierarchies go in practice?
- What are real-world cases where polymorphism solved a complex problem elegantly?
