# Interfaces vs Abstract Classes

> Phase 1.1 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Use both daily in C#
- Interface = contract, Abstract class = partial implementation
- C# 8+ allows default interface implementations (blurs the line)

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: When to use interface vs abstract class decision tree
- TODO: C# examples showing each use case
- TODO: How DI containers work with interfaces vs abstract classes
- TODO: Multiple inheritance through interfaces in C#

## Questions / Confusions

- With default interface methods in C# 8+, when do I still need abstract classes?
- How do other languages handle this differently (TypeScript, Java)?
- What's the performance difference (if any)?
