# Coupling and Cohesion

> Phase 1.1 | Status: Partial | Priority: MEDIUM

## Current Knowledge

- Experienced tight coupling firsthand in the Israeli 14-year-old monolith
- Loose coupling through DI is understood (AutoFac in FIS project)
- Need to formalize vocabulary and measurement

## Examples / Notes

- TODO: Types of coupling (content, common, control, stamp, data)
- TODO: Types of cohesion (coincidental, logical, temporal, procedural, functional)
- TODO: Code examples showing tight vs loose coupling
- TODO: How SOLID principles reduce coupling

## Questions / Confusions

- How to measure coupling in an existing codebase?
- What tools can help identify tightly coupled code?
- Is zero coupling even desirable? What's the right balance?
